# EASIER
- iptables nft makes script crash
- the whiptail rows numbers is currently fixed and could cause problems like lines exceding the screen border
- function to show the description of the installed packages
- sometimes curl has problems with ca authorities and cant download


# HARDER
- check if you have all the files in initial directory, if not download them
- if pacman fails to reinstall packages let it sync mirrors and try again
- try to figure out what would happen if you were to run the script twice with two different users
- In the future instead of a zip it should use only a .git file in $HOME and use that to sync all the configs, without having do unzip anything
- In the future some packages should be automatically be tagged, checking system configuration (like btrfs, tpm, ucode)
- check if sudo is installed and want to replace it with doas
- cleanup function
- make logs of operations so that if system shutdowns midgame you know about it
- listen for ctrl-c by user and if done so, put process in bg and ask user if they want to continue script or interrupt
- add option to reset all the signing keys https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Package_signing
- sometimes packages can't be installed from mirrors and sscipt crashes


# QUESTIONS
- what happens if there are already zhsrc config files in /root?
- what if sudo exists already exists or if you have a link to sudo already?
