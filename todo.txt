- the whiptail rows numbers is currently fixed and could cause problems like lines exceding the screen border
- function to show the description of the installed packages
- finalize scripts should be included in the script itself and appended to the corresponding files
- systemd-resolve
- logseq sync instead of logseq
- change tty font
- return function is bloated and has no real purpose, could be removed or at least thinned down
- cache_dir is used only for packages.csv at this point, maybe it could be removed(?)
